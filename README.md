This project focuses on introducing you to the world of Reinforcement Learning by solving puzzles (and interacting with us....) in the most fun way possible!!!!

## Week 0:

In the Week 0, we want you to learn Python (Python is a good relief if you're bored of C++ from CS 101 this sem) and modules like numpy, pandas and matplotlib (They are the goto libraries and the first imported when you're starting with any DS project, so it's good to have a grasp on them)

Choose whatever resource suits you and get acquainted with the modules to move forward with the project.

### Resources for Git

I'd love it if you also learn git for working with projects (it's very useful for version control and team integration)

This is a good lecture on git for beginners

### Resources for Python

This is a good video but long, should keep you occupied for a bit.

### Resources for Matplotlib

Some Python Notebooks for your practice can be found in the [Week 0 Folder](./Week%200/)


## Week 1:

In this week, you're gonna work on the Multi-Bandit Problem from Sutton and Barto (available in the resources folder)

You're going to implement the greedy and $\epsilon$-greedy algorithms and observe how one is better than the other and make changes

Read the Chapter in Sutton and Barto and implement the algorithms in the [work_on_bandits.ipynb](./Week%201/work_on_bandits.ipynb) file

## Week 2:

- The assignment in `Assignment_2.ipynb` is about simple modelling of some basic RL environment which is to help you understand the basic working of MDPs. Note that most problems we work with using RL always have a MDP working under the hood, which we may or may not(most of the times) know. We will explore this in later weeks

- The second is an **optional** reading assignment, [here](./Week%202/Markov_chains.pdf) which you can read if you intreseted in understanding and modelling of **Markov chains** in detail. Note that it requires some basic understanding of **probability, expected value and ranodom variables** so its ok if you don't understand in the beginning. Although it is important that you google these terms to get a baisc idea if you don't know them , as it will be used frequently in RL.
