# Jack's Car Rental

## Problem Statement

The problem statement of this assignment is to implement the Jack's Car Rental problem as described in the book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.

I know it's lazy on my part to just copy the problem statement from the book, but hehe ;)

So, I want you to train a model to give the optimal policy for the Jack's Car Rental problem. My solution to this problem looks something like this:
